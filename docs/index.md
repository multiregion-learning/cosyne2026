## Workshop Overview

A growing body of evidence suggests that many forms of biological learning (e.g. formation of novel stimulus associations, acquisition of motor skills) require coordinated changes in neural activity across large and spatially distributed populations of neurons. This perspective raises a challenging mechanistic question: **how can learning-related changes in neural populations be coordinated across regions, while being constrained by local synaptic plasticity rules?**

Our workshop will address this question by bringing together experimentalists and theorists who study large-scale neuronal activity across learning, and those who study the function and capabilities of synaptic plasticity for learning. We aim to facilitate discussions to constrain hypotheses, drive modeling efforts, and inspire novel paradigms to better relate our understanding of synaptic plasticity mechanisms to large-scale changes in neural activity within and between neuronal populations.

## Why This Workshop?

The topic of this workshop relates two subareas within experimental and computational neuroscience which have become increasingly prominent in recent years:

**Synaptic plasticity and population computation:** Recent computational and experimental efforts have sought to relate the properties of specific synaptic plasticity mechanisms between individual neurons to computational properties of their constituent populations. However, such studies often assume that learning is limited to synapses within a given brain region, with fixed connections from and within other brain areas.

**Large-scale multi-region recordings:** Novel experimental technologies have enabled large-scale recordings of neural activity simultaneously across multiple brain regions, which in turn gave rise to novel modeling efforts seeking to capture qualitative features of inter-region interactions. These developments highlight the fact that in well-trained animals, the activity of different brain areas is closely coupled, begging the question of how such interactions arise in the first place.
